# CA02
The goal of this project is to create a model to detect spam emails using Naive Bayes Algorithms.
Steps:
1. Use train emails to train the model.
2. Separate email content into individual words.
3. Train model using Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm
4. Test model using test emails

Libraries used:
1. os
2. numpy
3. collections.Counter
4. sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB
5. sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score

See train-mails and test-mails for files used.
